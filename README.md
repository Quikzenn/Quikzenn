# **Hi, I'm Rob!** :wave:

**I'm a junior front-end developer excited to share and grow my skills in a new working environment!** 

I am currently in the process of completing a web development bootcamp, where I have gained a strong foundation in various programming languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS and React. I am excited to apply my skills and continue learning as I enter the workforce and begin my career as a web developer. I am eager to find my first job and contribute my skills and passion to a team. I am a fast learner and am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow as a developer. I am confident that my skills and dedication will make me a valuable asset to any organization.
